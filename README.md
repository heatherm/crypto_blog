## Security

### Log-out button
By adding a prominent logout button, we help users to clear out the cookies after working.

### Forcing SSL
By always forcing SSL connection in our application config file for the production environment, we ensure that the cookies cannot be sniffed and help prevent XSS/session fixation. 

### Brakeman Scanning
Brakeman is a command-line tool that analyzes the source code of Ruby on Rails applications to find potential security vulnerabilities.
- Install with `bundle install`
- Run at app root with  `$ brakeman`
- [Result from April 30th](./brakeman_results.txt)

### Dependabot Alerts
Dependabot is integrated on our Github repository to get notified when one of our dependencies has a vulnerability. Dependabot will automatically keep our application up-to-date by updating dependencies in response to these alerts.
